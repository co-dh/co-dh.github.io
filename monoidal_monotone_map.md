# Monoidal monotone map
    (p1, p2) f ⊗  ≤ (p1,p2) ⊗ f
    
The image of the product is bigger than product of image, that is [generative effect](generative_effect.md).

I is just a special case of ⊗ when there is (p1,p2) is empty
    () f I  ≤ () I f

## Strong monoidal monotone: change ≤ to ≅
## Strict monoidal monotone: change ≤ to =

## Example:
    (ℕ, ≤, +) -> (ℝ, ≤, +) injection
    (B, ≤, ∧) -> Cost
