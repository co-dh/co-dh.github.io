# Galois Connection between preorders L and R
is a pair of monotone maps r: L->R, l: R->L that x.r <= y iff x <= y.l

I find that naming left adjoint l and right adjoint r is confusing, because l actually map x to the right, it's actually
to the right if you use it as a verb. So let me reverse l and r. 
    L      |     R
    y.l  <-[l]- y
    x    -[r]-> x.r
