# Good Notation Is Very Important
When deducting algorithm partition of an array, originally, I used the k's notation for array:

    (,1 2; (,1; ,2))
My brain has to count comma and bracket to decide the level of embedded array. I actually used almost a day on this
algorithm. But right after I switched to below notition to represent of partition of 1 2

    [[1 2]] [[1] [2]]
everything becomes easier.

A good notation should free you brain from processing unimportant information.

I'll give an example on Adjunction later.
