# V-category
A V-category is better understand with a Matrix whose element the SMP(Symmetric Monoidal Preorder) V.

## Examples:
Bool-category, Cost-category, Op(P)-category

## Preorders as Bool-categories.
View a preorder as a graph, and represent the graph as a Boolean matrix,
then the Boolean Matrix is the Bool-category.
