Given f: R->R, f is

| Prop               | Definition             | Relation Definition                |
|-                   |-                       |-                                   |
| order-preserving   | x <= y => f(x) <= f(y) | (x,y) in <= implies (fx, fy) in <= |
| metric-preserving  | abs x-y = abs f(x)-f(y)| z = abs x-y implies z = abs fx-fy  | 
| addition-preserving| f(x+y) =f(x)+f(y)      |                                    |

if view <= as relation, +/- as relation from R*R-> R,
z=abs x-y view as relatin:  x X y -[-]-> -[abs]-> z

```
(x,y) |       | - | abs => z
(x,y) |f each | - | abs => z
metric: - abs
f preserve metric: f metric = metric

f preserver order: f <= = <=

f preserve add: + f = f +  
```
