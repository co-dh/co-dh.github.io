# symmetric monoidal preoder: A preorder (X, ≤) with a symmetric monoidal (I, ⊗) that preserve order/close in it.
Preserver order:  **X ≤ Y ⇒ X.⊗ ≤ Y.⊗**, while X: (x1,x2), Y: (y1,y2)
Or: a monoid that close in (X, ≤)

##Examples
(ℝ, ≤, 0, +)

## How many close function from (0 1, ≤) to (0 1 2 3 4, ≤)? C(5, 2) = 10
    (0 1) -> 0 0, 0 1,..      0 4
          ->      1 1, 1 2, ..1 4
