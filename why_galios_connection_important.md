# Galios connections tell you the best possible way to recover data that can't be recovered.
The best approximation to reversing a computation that can't be reversed.

Given function double d: {2*x} in ℕ,  what's it's inverse function g?
d: 0 1 2 ->  0 2 4, so f 0 2 4 -> 0 1 2, but what's f 3? since it's monotone,  1  ≤ f 3  ≤ 2,
